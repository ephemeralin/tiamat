# Tincture: frontend

"Tincture" is a service which is aggregating different news feeds in one place. It is built for those who are annoyed by ads, subscriptions, "fat" web-sites, "smart" recommendations and infinite browsing between all that stuff.   
 
The service is available at: **https://tincture.ephemeralin.com/**

It is created using such technologies:

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org);
* [Blueprint.js](https://blueprintjs.com) as a UI toolkit;
* [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) for running React application.
